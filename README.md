## Problem Statement
The Bank Indessa has not done well in the last 3 quarters. Their NPAs (Non Performing Assets)
have reached all time high. It is starting to lose the confidence of its investors. As a result, itâ€™s stock
has fallen by 20% in the previous quarter alone.
After careful analysis, it was found that the majority of NPA was contributed by loan defaulters. With
the messy data collected over all the years, this bank has decided to use machine learning to figure
out a way to find these defaulters and devise a plan to reduce them.
This bank uses a pool of investors to sanction their loans. For example: If any customer has applied
for a loan of $20000, along with the bank, the investors perform due diligence on the requested loan
application. Keep this in mind while understanding data.
In this challenge, we help this bank by predicting the probability that a member will default.
